## Experiment: Study of Lists in Python    
### Title:  
### Study of Lists  

### Aim  
To study and understand lists in Python, their characteristics, operations, and commonly used list methods.

### Objectives  
To understand the concept of lists in Python

To learn how to create and access lists

To study list indexing and slicing

To perform insertion and deletion operations on lists

To understand built-in list functions and methods

### Theory  
Introduction to Lists

A list in Python is a built-in data structure used to store a collection of items in a single variable.

Characteristics of Lists:

Ordered collection

Mutable (elements can be changed)

Allows duplicate elements

Can store elements of different data types

Example:

my_list = [10, 20, 30, "Python", 5.5]

a) Creating and Accessing Lists  
Lists are created using square brackets []. Elements can be accessed using index values, starting from 0.

Example:

my_list[0] # First element my_list[-1] # Last element

List Indexing and Slicing
Indexing is used to access individual elements

Slicing is used to access a range of elements

Example:

my_list[1:4]

List Operations a) Adding Elements
append() – Adds an element at the end

insert() – Adds an element at a specific position

extend() – Adds multiple elements

b) Removing Elements

remove() – Removes a specific element

pop() – Removes an element at a given index

clear() – Removes all elements

#### Built-in List Functions and Methods  
len() – Returns number of elements

max() – Returns maximum value

min() – Returns minimum value

sum() – Returns sum of elements

sort() – Sorts the list

reverse() – Reverses the list

#### Traversing a List  
List elements can be accessed using loops such as for loop.

Example:

for item in my_list: print(item)

#### Conclusion  
Thus, the concept of lists in Python, their creation, operations, and built-in methods were studied and implemented successfully.
